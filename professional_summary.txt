Accomplished <b>Senior Delivery Consultant and Senior Business Analyst</b> with a strong foundation in software engineering and over 25 years of experience leading enterprise and consumer solutions.<br><br>

I recently spearheaded the design and launch of an automated system that eliminated manual healthcare license verifications, significantly improving data accuracy and operational efficiency.
